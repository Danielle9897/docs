# Design: Time Series

---

{NOTE: }

* Time series are sequences of numerical values, associated with timestamps 
  and sorted chronologically.  

* RavenDB Time Series are stored and managed as document extensions, gaining 
  much greater speed and efficiency than they would have had as JSON-formatted 
  data within a document.

#### Document Extension  

Each time series belongs to, or _extends_, one particular document. The 
document and the time series reference each other through:  

* A **reference to the time series** in the document's metadata.  
  The time series' **name** is kept in the document's metadata.  
  The time series' **data** is stored in a separate location.  
* A **reference to the document** in the time series data.  

---

#### Time Series Entries

Each time series entry is composed of:  

* `TimeSeriesEntry` 

    | Parameters | Type | Description |
    |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
    | `Timestamp` | DateTime (UTC) | The time of the event or data represented by the entry. Time is measured up to millisecond resolution. |
    | `Tag` | string | An optional tag for an entry. Can be any string up to 255 bytes. Possible uses for the tag: descriptions or metadata for individual entries; storing a document id, which can then be referenced when querying a time series. This is the only component of the entry that is not numerical. |
    | `Values` | double[] | An array of up to 32 `double` values |

{NOTE: }
Doubles with higher precision - i.e. more digits after the decimal point, 
are much less compressible.  
In other words, `1.672` takes up more space than `1672`.

#### The `HasTimeSeries` Flag

* When a document has one or more time series, RavenDB automatically adds  
  a `HasTimeSeries` flag in the document's metadata under `@flags`:

{CODE-BLOCK: JSON}
{
    "Name": "Paul",
    "@metadata": {
        "@collection": "Users",
        "@timeseries": [
            "my time series"
        ]
        "@flags": "HasTimeSeries"
    }
}
{CODE-BLOCK/}

* When all time series are deleted from a document, RavenDB 
automatically removes the flag.  

---

#### Segmentation

At the server storage level, time series data is divided into **segments**.  
Each segment contains a number of consecutive entries from the same time series.  

* **Segments Size and Limitations**  
    * Segments have a maximum size of 2 KB.  
      What this limit practically means, is that a segment can only contain 
      up to 32k entries and time series larger than that would always be stored 
      in multiple segments.  
    * In practice, segments usually contain far less than 32k entries, 
      depending on the size of the entries (after compression).  
      For example, in the [Northwind sample dataset](../../studio/database/tasks/create-sample-data), 
      the _Companies_ documents all have a time series called _StockPrice_. 
      These time series are stored in segments that have ~10-20 entries each.  
    * The maximum time gap between the first and last entries in a segment is 
      ~24.86 days (`int.MaxValue` milliseconds). Adding an entry that is further 
      than that from the first segment entry, would add it as the first entry 
      of a new segment. As a consequence, segments of sparsely-updated time series 
      can be significantly smaller than 2 KB.  
    * The maximum number of unique tags allowed per segment, is 127.  
      A higher number than that, would cause the creation of a new segment.  

* **Aggregate Values**  
  RavenDB automatically stores and updates aggregate values in each segment's header, 
  that summarize commonly-used values regarding this segment, including -  
   - The segment's **First** value  
   - The segment's **Last** value  
   - The segment's **Max** value  
   - The segment's **Min** value  
   - The segment's **Count** of values  
   - The segment's values **Sum**  

      {NOTE: }
      The existence of aggregate values makes it worthwhile to reference individual 
      segments in indexes and queries.  
      {NOTE/}

      {NOTE: }
      When segment entries store multiple values, e.g. each entry contains a **Latitude** value 
      and a **Longitude** value, the six aggregate values are kept for each value separately.  
      {NOTE/}

#### Compression

Time series data is stored using a format called [Gorilla compression](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf). 
On top of the Gorilla compression, the time series segments are compressed 
using the [LZ4 algorithm](https://lz4.github.io/lz4/).

#### Document Change  

* **Name Change**  
  **Creating** or **deleting** a time series adds or removes its name 
  to/from the metadata of the document it belongs to.  
  This modification triggers a document-change event, and processes such 
  as revisions.  
* **Data Updates**  
  Modifying time series data does **not** invoke a document-change event, 
  as long as it doesn't create a new time series or remove an existing one.  

---

#### Success

Updating a time series is designed to succeed without causing a concurrency conflict.  
As long as the document it extends exists, updating a time series will always succeed.  

---

#### No Conflicts

Time series actions do not cause conflicts.  

* **Time series updated concurrently by multiple cluster nodes**:  

    When a time series' data is replicated by multiple nodes, the data 
    from all nodes is merged into a single series.  
    
    When multiple nodes append **different values** at the same timestamp: 
      * If the nodes try to append a **different number of values** for the same 
        timestamp, the **bigger amount of values** is applied.  
      * If the nodes to append the same number of values, the first values from 
        each node are compared. The append whose first value sorts higher 
        [_lexicographically_](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LexicographicOrder.html) 
        (not numerically) is applied.  
        For example, lexicographic order would sort numbers like this: 
        `1 < 10 < 100 < 2 < 21 < 22 < 3`  
      * If an existing value at a certain timestamp is deleted by one node 
        and updated by another node, the deletion is applied.  

* **Time series update By multiple clients of the same node**:  
    * When a time series' value at a certain timestamp is appended by 
      multiple clients more or less simultaneously, RavenDB uses the last-write 
      strategy.  
    * When an existing value at a certain timestamp is deleted by a client 
      and updated by another client, RavenDB still uses the last-write 
      strategy.

#### Transactions

When a session transaction that includes a time series modification 
fails for any reason, the time series modification is reverted.  

---

#### Case Insensitive

All time series operations are case insensitive. E.g. -
{CODE-BLOCK:JSON}
session.TimeSeriesFor("users/john", "HeartRate")
                        .Delete(baseline.AddMinutes(1));
{CODE-BLOCK/}
is equivalent to 
{CODE-BLOCK:JSON}
session.TimeSeriesFor("users/john", "HEARTRATE")
                        .Delete(baseline.AddMinutes(1));
{CODE-BLOCK/}
