{NOTE: }

* You can run queries over indexes you have created for your time-series.  

    {INFO: }
    Note that time-series are **not** automatically indexed.  
    To index a time-series, define a [static index](../../../document-extensions/timeseries/indexing/map-indexing) 
    for it manually.
