{NOTE/}

This section of the documentation discusses differences between 4.x and 5.0 Client API and focuses on giving guides how to finalize the process in as few steps as possible. The major set of changes is related to the introduction of abstract later over JSON serialization. The changes are relatively small when it comes to migration, but still require few actions like namespace adjustments or document conventions reconfiguration.
