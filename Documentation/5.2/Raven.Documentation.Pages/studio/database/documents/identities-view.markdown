# Identities View

{NOTE: }

* The view lists the __latest values__ for all identities in the database. 

* You can edit existing values or add new identities.

* Identities values can also be managed from the Client API, see [seed identity operation](../../../client-api/operations/maintenance/identities/seed-identity).

{PANEL: What is an identity}

* An identity is a document ID generated by the server upon document creation time  
  (when adding a pipe `|` as a suffix to the requested document ID).

* The identity ID is __unique__ in the database, across all nodes within the Database Group.

* The identity document ID is composed of:  
  * The collection name  
  * And a number that is continuously incremented per document creation  
    e.g. `employees/5`

* Learn more about identities in:
  * [Document identifier generation](../../../server/kb/document-identifier-generation#identity)
  * [Working with document identifiers](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/working-with-document-identifiers#identities)

{PANEL: The latest values}

This list shows the latest values for all identities in the database that where either:  

  * [Created via this view](../../../studio/database/documents/identities-view#add-new-identity)

  * Or created when saving a document 

![Figure 1. Latest identities values](images/identities-view-1.png "Latest values")

1. Navigate to __Documents > Identities__

2. __Document ID Prefix__  
   This string is the collection name (showing with a pipe suffix).   

3. __Latest Value__  

   * This is the latest identity value currently assigned for the collection.

   * In this example the latest value for the _employees_ collection is `3`.  
     This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _employees_ collection  
     will get the ID `employees/4`.

4. Click to edit the latest value.

5. Click to add a new identity value for another collection.

{PANEL: Edit identity value}

![Figure 2. Edit identity value](images/identities-view-2.png "Edit identity value")

1. __Prefix__  
   The collection for which the value is edited.

2. __Value__  

   * Enter a number that will be set as the latest identity value for this collection.

   * In this example we set the value to `25`.  
     This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _employees_ collection  
     will get the ID `employees/26`.

3. Click 'Update' to set the new value.

{PANEL: Add new identity}

![Figure 3. Add new identity](images/identities-view-3.png "Add new identity")

1. __Prefix__  

   * Enter the collection name for which to set an identity value.  
     (Using the pipe suffix here is optional, e.g. can enter "users" or "users|").
   
   * Note: you can specify a collection name that has not been created yet.  

2. __Value__

    * Enter a number that will be set as the latest identity value for this collection.

    * In this example we set the value to `99`.  
      This means the next document that will be created with an identity in the _users_ collection  
      will get the ID `users/100`.

3. Click 'Create' to create the new identity.
