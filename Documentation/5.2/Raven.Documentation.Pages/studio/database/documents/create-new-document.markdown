# Create New Document
---

{NOTE: }

* From the Studio, a new document can be added to a database to either an existing collection or a new one

* The new document ID can be generated as any one of the following types:  
  * **Server-Side ID**  
  * **Semantic ID**  
  * **Identity**  
  * **GUID**  
  * **Artificial Document ID**  

* An ID generated by the [HiLo Algorithm](../../../client-api/document-identifiers/hilo-algorithm) ***cannot*** be generated from the Studio, only from the RavenDB Client  

* For a full description about all the different ID types see [Document Identifier Generation](../../../server/kb/document-identifier-generation)  

* In this page:  
  * [Create New Document](../../../studio/database/documents/create-new-document#create-new-document)  
  * [Create New Document in Current Collection](../../../studio/database/documents/create-new-document#create-new-document-in-current-collection)

* 1 - **Enter document ID** - see the [examples](../../../studio/database/documents/create-new-document#document-id-types---examples) below  
  * Any collection name can be entered as a prefix.  
  * The collection name will be created if it doesn't exist yet.  
  * If no collection name is specified, i.e. the ID string doesn't end with ( / ) or ( | ),  
    then the document will be added to the _@empty_ collection.  

* 2 - **Edit document content**    
  Edit the document fields, the above document content showing is just an initial template.  

* 3 - Click `Save` when done

{PANEL: Create New Document in Current Collection}

![Figure 4. Edit the New Document](images/create-new-document-4.png "Edit the New Document")

* 1 - **Enter document ID**  
  * The current collection name is initially suggested.  
  * Any other collection name of your choice can still be entered,  
    document creation will be handled as described above in 'Create New Document'.  

* 2 - **Edit document content**  
  * Edit the document fields
  * If all the documents in the collection have the same 'structure', i.e. same fields,  
    then the initial document content showing will be those fields.  
    (In the above example the fields are: 'ID Type' & 'Name')  
  * If _not_ all documents share the exact same fields,  
    then the initial document content will be just the initial template as in 'Create New Document'.  

* 3 - Click `Save` when done

{PANEL: Create New Document from Clone}

![Figure 5. Create New Document from Clone](images/create-new-document-5.png "Create New Document from Clone")

A new document can be created by cloning from an opened [document view](../../../studio/database/documents/document-view) 
and saved with a new ID.  

* Click the 'Clone' button to create a clone from the current document.  
* The original document attachments, counters & time-series items are copied into the clone.  
* Modify the cloned document as needed and save it as a new document.

![Figure 6. IDs Examples](images/create-new-document-6.png "IDs Examples")

1. **Semantic ID**  
   This ID was generated by entering the actual string in the document ID.  
   i.e. **"users/ayende@hr.com"**  

2. **Server-Side ID**  
   This ID was generated by entering: **"users/"** in the document ID.  
   Note: the first document was created from node 'A' while the other one from node 'B'.  

3. **Identity**  
   This ID was generated by entering: **"users|"** in the document ID.  

4. **GUID**  
   This ID was generated by leaving the document ID field **empty** and just clicking 'Save'
