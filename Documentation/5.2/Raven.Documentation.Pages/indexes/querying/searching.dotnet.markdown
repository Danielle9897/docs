# Full-Text Search with Index
---

{NOTE: }

* __Prior to this article__, please refer to article [Full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search)  
  to learn about the `Search` method.  

* __All capabilities__ provided by `Search` with a dynamic query can also be used when querying a static-index.

* However, as opposed to making a dynamic search query where an auto-index is created for you,  
  when using a __static-index__:  

    * You must configure the index-field in which you want to search.  
      See examples below.  
      
    * You can configure which analyzer will be used to tokenize this field.  
      See [selecting an analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#selecting-an-analyzer-for-a-field).

__Query with Search__:

---

* Use `Search` to make a full-text search when querying the index.  

* Refer to [Full-Text search with dynamic queries](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search) for all available __Search options__,  
  such as using wildcards, searching for multiple terms, etc.

{PANEL: Boosting search results}

* In order to prioritize results, you can provide a boost value to the searched terms.  
  This can be applied by either of the following:

  * Add a boost value to the relevant index-field __inside the index definition__.  
    Refer to article [indexes - boosting](../../indexes/boosting).

  * Add a boost value to the queried terms __at query time__.  
    Refer to article [Boost search results](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/boost-search-results).
