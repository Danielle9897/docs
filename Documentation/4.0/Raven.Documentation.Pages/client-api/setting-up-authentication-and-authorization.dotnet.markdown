# Client API: Setting up Authentication and Authorization
---
{NOTE: }

* **Authentication and authorization** are based on [Client X.509 Certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions).  

* When your RavenDB instance runs on **HTTPS**, the server has a Server Certificate loaded. Your application must use a Client Certificate in order to access this secure server.  

* Obtain a Client Certificate from your cluster admin. The Client Certificate is generated by the admin from the [Studio](../server/security/authentication/certificate-management).  

* The security clearance (authorization level) for the generated Client Certificate is set during the process of generating the certificate.  

* Pass your Client Certificate to the Document Store before initialization, as shown in the example code [below](../client-api/setting-up-authentication-and-authorization#example---initializing-document-store-with-a-client-certificate).
The server will use this certificate to authenticate the client when connection is established.
