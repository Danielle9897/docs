{NOTE: }

* The **Server Settings** view displays settings common to all the databases 
  hosted by the server.  
* This is a **read-only** view, showing settings made using 
  [environment variables](../../server/configuration/configuration-options#environment-variables), 
  the [settings.json](../../server/configuration/configuration-options#settings.json) 
  configuration file, and [command line arguments](../../server/configuration/configuration-options#command-line-arguments).  
* For the server settings view open **Manage Server** `>>` **Server Settings**  
* To modify the settings of individual databases use the [Database Settings](../../studio/database/settings/database-settings) view.
