# Proximity Search

---

{NOTE: }

* A **proximity search** retrieves documents containing search terms that are located within a specified distance from each other.
  The distance is measured by the number of intermediate terms.

* Proximity search is available only via [DocumentQuery](../../../../client-api/session/querying/document-query/what-is-document-query) or RQL.  
 
* Use the `Proximity` method when running a **full-text search** by the [Search](../../../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search) method.

{PANEL: Why use proximity search}

* A basic linguistic assumption is that the proximity of words implies a relationship between them.

* Proximity search helps match phrases while avoiding scattered or spread-out terms in the text.

* By limiting the search to only include matches where the terms are within the specified maximum proximity,  
  the search results can be more relevant than those with scattered terms.

{PANEL: How proximity works}

* When searching with some specified distance between search terms `term1` and `term2`:

    * Retrieved documents will contain text in which `term1` and `term2` are separated by  
      the maximum number of terms specified or less.

    * The search terms can be separated by fewer terms, but not more than the specified distance.

    * Only the terms generated by the [search analyzer](../../../../indexes/using-analyzers#ravendb) 
      are considered towards the count of the maximum distance.  
      Words or tokens that are Not part of the generated terms are Not included in the proximity calculation.

* Note:

    * Search criteria should contain at least 2 search terms.

    * Search terms must be simple string terms without wildcards.
