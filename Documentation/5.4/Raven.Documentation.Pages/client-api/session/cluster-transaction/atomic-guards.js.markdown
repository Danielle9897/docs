# Cluster Transaction - Atomic Guards
---

{NOTE: }

* **Atomic Guards** are [compare exchange](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview) 
  key/value items that RavenDB creates and manages automatically to guarantee 
  [ACID](../../../server/clustering/cluster-transactions#cluster-transaction-properties) 
  transactions in cluster-wide sessions.  
  Each document will be associated with its own unique atomic guard item.

* Atomic guards coordinate work between sessions that try to write on a document at the same time.  
  Saving a document is prevented if another session has incremented the atomic guard Raft index, 
  which is triggered by changing the document.

* Prior to the introduction of this feature (in **RavenDB 5.2**), client code had to 
  administer compare-exchange entries explicitly. You can still do that if you wish by 
  [disabling](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards#disabling-atomic-guards) 
  the automatic usage of atomic guards in a session and defining and managing compare exchange 
  key/value pairs 
  [yourself](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview#example-i---email-address-reservation) 
  where needed.  
  {WARNING: }
  We strongly recommend **not to manage atomic guards manually** since doing so could cancel RavenDB's 
  ACID transaction guarantees. Read more about this [here](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/atomic-guards#disabling-atomic-guards).

{PANEL: How Atomic Guards Work}

Atomic guards are created and managed by default __only when the session's transaction mode is set to 
[ClusterWide](../../../client-api/session/cluster-transaction/overview#open-a-cluster-transaction)__.  
The atomic guards are managed as follows:
 
* __New document__:  
  A new atomic guard is created when successfully saving a new document.  
  
* __Existing document that doesn't have an atomic guard__:  
  A new atomic guard is created when modifying an existing document that does not yet have an associated atomic guard.

* __Existing document that already has an atomic guard__:  

    * Whenever one session modifies a document that already has an associated atomic guard,  
      the value of its related atomic guard increases.  
      This allows RavenDB to detect that changes were made to this document.
  
    * If other sessions have loaded the document before the version changed,  
      they will not be able to modify it if trying to save after the first session already saved it,  
      and a `ConcurrencyException` will be thrown.

    * If the session `saveChanges()` fails, the entire session is rolled-back and the atomic guard is not created.  
      Be sure that your business logic is written so that if a concurrency exception is thrown, your code will re-execute the entire session.

{PANEL: Atomic Guard Transaction Scope}

* Atomic guards are local to the database they were defined on.  

* Since atomic guards are implemented as compare-exchange items,  
  they are Not externally replicated to another database by any ongoing replication task.  
  Learn more in [why compare-exhange items are not replicated](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview#why-compare-exchange-items-are-not-replicated-to-external-databases).

{PANEL: Syntax and Usage}

In the code sample below, an atomic guard is automatically created upon the creation of a new document,  
and then used when two sessions compete on changing the document.

{CODE:nodejs atomic-guards-enabled@client-api/session/ClusterTransaction/AtomicGuards.js /}

After running the above example, the atomic guard that was automatically created can be viewed in the Studio,  
in the [Compare-Exchange view](../../../studio/database/documents/compare-exchange-view#the-compare-exchange-view):

![Atomic Guard](images/atomic-guard.png "Atomic Guard")

The generated atomic guard key name is composed of:

* The prefix `rvn-atomic`
* The ID of the document that it is associated with

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Disabling Atomic Guards}

To **disable** the automatic creation & usage of atomic guards in a session, set the session 
`disableAtomicDocumentWritesInClusterWideTransaction` configuration option to `true`.  

In the sample below, the session uses **no atomic guards**.  
{CODE:nodejs atomic-guards-disabled@client-api/session/ClusterTransaction/AtomicGuards.js /}

{WARNING: Warning}

* To enable **ACIDity in cluster-wide transactions** when atomic guards are disabled,  
  you have to explicitly [set and use](../../../client-api/operations/compare-exchange/overview) 
  the required compare exchange key/value pairs.  

* Only disable and edit atomic guards if you truly know what you're doing as it can negatively 
  impact ACID transaction guarantees.  

* **Do not remove or edit** atomic guards manually while a session is using them.  
  A session that is currently using these removed atomic guards will not be able to save 
  their related documents resulting in an error.  
  * If you accidentally remove an active atomic guard that is associated with an existing document, 
    recreate or save the document again in a cluster-wide session which will re-create the atomic guard.  
{WARNING/}

{PANEL: When are Atomic Guards Removed}

Atomic guards expire on the expiration of the documents they are used for and are automatically 
removed by a RavenDB cleanup task. You do not need to handle the cleanup yourself.  

{NOTE: }
Since different cleanup tasks handle the removal of deleted and expired documents 
and the removal of expired atomic guards, it may happen that atomic guards of removed 
documents would linger in the compare exchange entries list a short while longer before 
they are removed.  

* You do **not** need to remove such atomic guards yourself, they will be removed by 
  the cleanup task.  
* You **can** re-create expired documents whose atomic guards haven't been removed yet.  
  RavenDB will create new atomic guards for such documents, and expire the old ones.
