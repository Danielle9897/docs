{PANEL: License keys}

License keys for versions lower than `6.0` are **not supported** by RavenDB `6.0`.  
If you own a valid license key for RavenDB `5.x` or lower, please upgrade it using 
the quick online interface described [here](../../start/licensing/replace-license#upgrade-a-license-key-for-ravendb-6.x).

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: RavenDB for Docker}

RavenDB now applies an improved security model, and uses a **dedicated user** rather than `root`.  
Read more about this change [here](../../migration/server/docker).  

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Unsupported sharding features}

RavenDB `6.0` introduces [sharding](../../sharding/overview). 
Server and client features that are currently unavailable in a sharded database (but remain available in regular databases) are listed [here](../../sharding/unsupported).  

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Graph queries}

[Graph Queries](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/5.4/csharp/indexes/querying/graph/graph-queries-overview) support, 
available in RavenDB versions `4.2` to `5.x`, has been removed from the RavenDB `6.x` server and client API.  

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: SQL ETL}

SQL ETL no longer tolerates errors on `Load`, load errors are thrown immediately.  
This is done to distinguish partial load errors that are used in SQL ETL from, for example, commit errors that may happen during load.
(Prior to this change, the ETL would just advance instead of retrying.)

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: DateOnly & TimeOnly}

[DateOnly and TimeOnly](../../client-api/how-to/using-timeonly-and-dateonly) types are now supported for every new auto index.

{PANEL: Full-text search with wildcards}

Starting with `6.0` we have changed how the [Search method](../../indexes/querying/searching) handles wildcards when they are included in search terms:

##### Behavior for versions lower than `6.0`:  

After the analyzer stripped wildcards from the search term, 
RavenDB would attempt to restore the `*` to their original positions before sending the term to the search engine (Lucene or Corax). 

##### Behavior for `6.0` and up:

Once wildcards are stripped by the analyzer, we no longer add them back before sending the term to the search engine.
The search terms sent to the search engine are solely based on the transformations applied by the analyzer used.

Note the different behavior in the following cases: 

{NOTE: }

**When using `StandardAnalyzer` or `NGramAnalyzer`**:

---

Usually, the same analyzer used to tokenize field content at **indexing time** is also used to process the terms provided in the **full-text search query**
before they are sent to the search engine to retrieve matching documents.

However, in the following cases:

* When making a [dynamic search query](../../client-api/session/querying/text-search/full-text-search) 
* or when querying a static index that uses the default `StandardAnalyzer`
* or when querying a static index that uses the `NGramAnalyzer`

the queried terms in the `Search` method are processed with the **`LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer`** analyzer before being sent to the search engine.  

This analyzer does Not remove the `*`, so the terms are sent with `*` as provided in the search terms.

{NOTE/}
{NOTE: }

**When using a Custom Analyzer**:

---

When setting a [custom analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers#creating-custom-analyzers) in your index to tokenize field content, 
then when querying the index, the search terms in the query will be processed according to the custom analyzer's logic.  

The `*` will remain in the terms if the custom analyzer allows it.
It is the userâ€™s responsibility to ensure that wildcards are not removed by the custom analyzer if they should be included in the query.

{NOTE/}
{NOTE: }

**When using the Exact Analyzer:**

---

When using `KeywordAnalyzer`(the default Exact analyzer) in your index,
then when querying the index, the wildcards in your query terms remain untouched, the terms are sent to the search engine exactly as prepared by the analyzer.
