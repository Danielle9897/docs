# Create a Database: Encrypted

{NOTE: }

* Encrypted databases in RavenDB use Daniel J. Bernstein's [XChaCha20-Poly1305](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/secret-key_cryptography/aead/chacha20-poly1305/xchacha20-poly1305_construction) 
 authenticated encryption algorithm. They are encrypted at rest and by default, also in transit.  

* Encryption is possible only if [security authentication is enabled](../../../../start/installation/setup-wizard) and a server certificate is defined.

* Learn more about **encryption** in: [Encryption At Rest](../../../../server/security/encryption/encryption-at-rest).  
  Learn how to enable **authentication** in: [Certificate Configuration](../../../../server/security/authentication/certificate-configuration).  
  Learn about the **secret key** in: [Secret Key Management](../../../../server/security/encryption/secret-key-management).

1. **Name**  
   Give this database a meaningful name.  

2. **Encryption**  
   Toggle to activate encryption on the new database.  When it is activated, the **Encryption Configuration** view with the key and QR code should open.  

3. **Key**  
   * This is the base 64 key generated by the server.  
   * A different new key can be generated by the server when clicking the `refresh` button.  
   * Learn more about this key in: [Secret Key Management](../../../../server/security/encryption/secret-key-management)  

4. **QR Code**  
   * The QR code representing the key  

5. **Confirm that you've securely saved the key**  
   {WARNING: WARNING}

   * You will not have access to the database if the key is lost.  
   * Download, print, or copy and save the key in a safe place. **It will not be available again!**
