# Patching: How to Perform Single Document Patch Operations

{NOTE: }

* The **Patch** operation is used to perform *partial* document updates with **one trip to the server**, 
  instead of loading, modifying, and saving a full document. 
  The whole operation is executed on the server-side and is useful as a performance enhancement or for 
  updating denormalized data in entities.

* Since the operation is executed in a single request to a database, the patch command is performed in a single write [transaction](../../../client-api/faq/transaction-support).

* The current page covers patch operations on single documents.

* Patching has three possible interfaces: [Typed Session API](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document#typed-session-api), 
[Non-Typed Session API](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document#non-typed-session-api), 
and [Operations API](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document#operations-api).

* Patching can be done from the [client API](../../../client-api/operations/patching/single-document#examples) as well as in the [studio](../../../studio/database/documents/patch-view).

## API Overview

{PANEL: Typed Session API}

A type-safe session interface that allows performing the most common patch operations.  
The patch request will be sent to the server only after the call to `SaveChanges`. This way it's possible to perform multiple operations in one request to the server.  

{NOTE: }

### Increment Field Value
`Session.Advanced.Increment`
{CODE patch_generic_interface_increment@ClientApi\Operations\Patches\PatchRequests.cs /}

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **T** | `Type` | Entity type |
| **U** | `Type` | Field type, must be of numeric type or a `string` of `char` for string concatenation |
| **entity** | `T` | Entity on which the operation should be performed. The entity should be one that was returned by the current session in a `Load` or `Query` operation, this way, the session can track down the entity's ID |
| **entity id** | `string` | Entity ID on which the operation should be performed. |
| **fieldPath** | `Expression<Func<T, U>>` | Lambda describing the path to the field. |
| **delta** | `U` | Value to be added. |

{PANEL:Non-Typed Session API}

The non-typed Session API for patches uses the `Session.Advanced.Defer` function which allows registering one or more commands.  
One of the possible commands is the `PatchCommandData`, describing single document patch command.  
The patch request will be sent to the server only after the call to `SaveChanges`, this way it's possible to perform multiple operations in one request to the server.  

`Session.Advanced.Defer`
{CODE patch_non_generic_interface_in_session@ClientApi\Operations\Patches\PatchRequests.cs /}

{INFO: PatchCommandData}

| Constructor| Type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------|
| **id** | `string` | ID of the document to be patched. |
| **changeVector** | `string` | [Can be null] Change vector of the document to be patched, used to verify that the document was not changed before the patch reached it. |
| **patch** | `PatchRequest` | Patch request to be performed on the document. |
| **patchIfMissing** | `PatchRequest` | [Can be null] Patch request to be performed if no document with the given ID was found. |

{INFO/}

{INFO: PatchRequest}

We highly recommend using scripts with parameters. This allows RavenDB to cache scripts and boost performance. 
Parameters can be accessed in the script through the `args` object and passed using PatchRequest's "Values" parameter.

| Members | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **Script** | `string` | JavaScript code to be run. |
| **Values** | `Dictionary<string, object>` | Parameters to be passed to the script. The parameters can be accessed using the '$' prefix. Parameter starting with a '$' will be used as is, without further concatenation. |

{INFO/}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Operations API}

An operations interface that exposes the full functionality and allows performing ad-hoc patch operations without creating a session.  

`Raven.Client.Documents.Operations.Send`  
`Raven.Client.Documents.Operations.SendAsync`  

{CODE patch_non_generic_interface_in_store@ClientApi\Operations\Patches\PatchRequests.cs /}

{INFO: PatchOperation}

| Constructor| Type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------|
| **id** | `string` | ID of the document to be patched. |
| **changeVector** | `string` | [Can be null] Change vector of the document to be patched, used to verify that the document was not changed before the patch reached it. |
| **patch** | `PatchRequest` | Patch request to be performed on the document. |
| **patchIfMissing** | `PatchRequest` | [Can be null] Patch request to be performed if no document with the given ID was found. Will run only if no `changeVector` was passed. |
| **skipPatchIfChangeVectorMismatch** | `bool` | If false and `changeVector` has value, and document with that ID and change vector was not found, will throw an exception. |

{PANEL: List of Script Methods}

This is a list of a few of the javascript methods that can be used in patch scripts. See the 
more comprehensive list at [Knowledge Base: JavaScript Engine](../../../server/kb/javascript-engine#predefined-javascript-functions).  

| Method | Arguments | Description |
| - | - | - |
| **load** | `string` or `string[]` | Loads one or more documents into the context of the script by their document IDs |
| **loadPath** | A document and a path to an ID within that document | Loads a related document by the path to its ID |
| **del** | Document ID; change vector | Delete the given document by its ID. If you add the expected change vector and the document's current change vector does not match, the document will _not_ be deleted. |
| **put** | Document ID; document; change vector | Create or overwrite a document with a specified ID and entity. If you try to overwrite an existing document and pass the expected change vector, the put will fail if the specified change vector does not match the document's current change vector. |
| **cmpxchg** | Key | Load a compare exchange value into the context of the script using its key |
| **getMetadata** | Document | Returns the document's metadata |
| **id** | Document | Returns the document's ID |
