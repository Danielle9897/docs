{PANEL:Create and CreateForRevisions overloads summary}

Subscription creation is accessible through `DocumentStore`'s `subscriptions()` method, of type `DocumentSubscriptions`:
{CODE:java subscriptionCreationOverloads@ClientApi\DataSubscriptions\DataSubscriptions.java /}

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **clazz** | `Class` | Subscription item class |
| **options** | `SubscriptionCreationOptions` | Contains subscription creation options |
| **database** | `String` | Name of database to create a data subscription. If `null`, default database configured in DocumentStore will be used. |

| Return value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `String` | Created data subscription name. If Name was provided in SubscriptionCreationOptions, it will be returned, otherwise, a unique name will be generated by server. |

{PANEL:SubscriptionCreationOptions}

Non generic version of the class, relies on user's full knowledge of the RQL query structure

| Member | Type | Description |
|--------|:-----|-------------| 
| **name** | `String` | User defined name of the subscription: allows to have a human readable identification of a subscription. The name must be unique in the database. |
| **query** | `String` | **Required.** RQL query that describes the subscription. That RQL comes with additional support to javascript clause inside the 'Where' statement and special semantics for subscriptions on documents revisions. |
| **changeVector** | `String` | Allows to define a change vector, from which the subscription will start processing. It might be useful for ad-hoc processes that need to process only recent changes in data, for that specific use, the field may receive a special value: "LastDocument", that will take the latest change vector in the machine. |
| **mentorNode** | `String` | Allows to define a specific node in the cluster that we want to treat the subscription. That's useful in cases when one server is preffered over other, either because of stronger hardware or closer geographic proximity to clients etc. |

{PANEL: Subscription query} 

All subscriptions, are eventually translated to an RQL-like statement. These statements has four parts:

* Functions definition part, like in ordinary RQL. Those functions can contain any javascript code,
  and also supports `load` and `include` operations.

* From statement, defining the documents source, ex: `from Orders`. The from statement can only address collections, therefore, indexes are not supported.    

* Where statement describing the criteria according to which it will be decided to either 
send the documents to the worker or not. Those statements support the regular RQL syntax, 
except the geo-spatial functions, which not supported by subscriptions. 
In addition to that, the subscription's where statement can contain defined function calls, 
allowing performing complex filtering logic.

* Select statement, that defines the projection to be performed. 
The select statements can contain function calls, allowing complex transformations.

* Include statement allowing to define include path in document.  

{INFO: Syntax limitations}
Although subscription's query syntax is RQL-like there are keywords that are not supported:  
* `Distinct`  
* `index` (query an index)  
* `OrderBy`  
* `GroupBy`    
* `Array`  
* `Sum`  
* `Min`  
* `Max`  
* `Avg`  
* `Update`  
* `Count`  
* `Lucene`  
* `moreLikeThis`  
* `spatial.within`  
* `spatial.contains`  
* `spatial.disjoint`  
* `spatial.intersects`  
* `spatial.circle`  
* `spatial.wkt`  
* `spatial.point`  
{INFO/}

{INFO: Revisions}
In order to define a data subscription that uses documents revisions, there first has to be revisions configured for the specific collection.  
The subscription should be defined in a special way:  
* In case of the generic API, use method 'createForRevisions' instead of 'create'  
* For RQL syntax, the `(Revisions = true)` statement should be concatenated to the collection to be queries.  Ex: `From orders(Revisions = true) as o`
