{PANEL: Available support options}

Cloud offers two support options - **Free** and **Paid**.

Cloud offers the **Free support option** for all Accounts by default.  
Our **Free support option** covers the availability of your Cloud instance services,
responding to any connectivity issues, and your participation in mailing lists and forums.

The **Paid support option** gives the support you need to get your instances up and running.  
Additional monitoring of your system, focus on building better *RavenDB* applications, and architectural guidance.  
We also provide bug fixes, email and phone support, and access to the *RavenDB* core developers. 

You can choose between a **Paid support option** period of **6 months** or **12 months**.

{INFO: }

**40%** of hosting cost for **6 months** contract and **30%** of hosting cost for **12 months** contract.

{WARNING: }

| **Severity** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minor        | Non-critical errors, general questions, requests for enhancements to the Software.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Normal       | The error is not critical - no data has been lost, and the system has not failed. The error has been identified and does not prevent normal operation, or the situation may be temporarily circumvented using an available workaround.                                    |
| Critical     | Due to an error in a production environment, the Software is down or seriously impacted, or there is no workaround currently available or the workaround is cumbersome to use, or the Customer data is lost or destroyed, and there is no workaround currently available. |

{INFO: }
**Critical severity** is only available for Customers with the **Paid support option**.
