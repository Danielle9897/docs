| **Severity** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minor        | Non-critical errors, general questions, requests for enhancements to the Software.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Normal       | The error is not critical - no data has been lost, and the system has not failed. The error has been identified and does not prevent normal operation, or the situation may be temporarily circumvented using an available workaround. |
| Critical     | Due to an error in a production environment, the Software is down or seriously impacted, or there is no workaround currently available, or the workaround is cumbersome to use, or the Customer data is lost or destroyed.             |

{INFO: }
**Critical severity** is available only to customers with the **Cloud Support option**.
