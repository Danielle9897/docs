{PANEL: Available support options}

RavenDB Cloud offers two support options - **Free** and **Cloud Support**.

RavenDB Cloud offers the **Free support option** for all Accounts by default.  
Our **Free support option** covers the availability of your RavenDB Cloud instance services,
responding to any connectivity issues, and your participation in mailing lists and forums.

---

The **Cloud Support option** provides the support you need to keep your database in good shape.  
Additional monitoring of your system, focus on building better *RavenDB* applications, and architectural guidance.  
Prioritized bug fixes, email and phone support, and access to the *RavenDB* core developers is in the package.

You can select one of 2 terms - **6 months** or **12 months**, which differ in price.

{WARNING: }
The **Cloud Support option** requires at least **one production tier** instance.
