{PANEL: Pricing}

You can choose one of three pricing modes:  

* On Demand  
  Come and go as you like, we charge you by the hour.  
  If you require less than an hour, we still charge you by the hour.  

  This pricing method may be useful for various short-term occasions like a qbrief test configuration, 
  a few-hours project, or if you'd just like to briefly examine the database or its features.  
  When these circumstances pass, it would probably be more effective, cost-wise and in other respects, 
  to choose one of the longer-term paying course.  

* Yearly  
  There are two yearly pricing courses.  
   * You commit to a year, and pay monthly.  
     This course grants you a 5% discount.  
   * You pay in advance for the whole year.  
     This course grants you a 10% discount.  

  Both yearly courses oblige you to keep-on paying for the duration of the whole year.  
  You cannot remove your instances and stop your charges.  
  If you upgrade or downgrade an instance you will still be charged by your yearly contract, but 
  on an On-Demand basis.  

The pricing courses do **not** include all your expanses.  
All charges appear in the Pricing tab. They may include:  
* **Disk Space storage costs**  
  In case your data occupies more space than covered by your contract or pre-payment cover.  
* **Backup Storage costs**  
  This is actually the same expanse as the first. Backed up data occupies storage space. If 
  storage usage breaches 90% we automatically enhance your hard disk volume to prevent an overflow, 
  and charge you for it.  
* **Traffic costs**  
  In case the amount of transferred data exceeds the amount you paid for.

{PANEL: Payment}

You can currently pay by credit card or wire transfer.  

* Credit Card  
  You can provide your credit card/s details while creating your account or afterwards, 
  while creating or editing an instance.  
  In both cases, providing Payment Information is the third stage (after choosing an email 
  address and a domain).  
   * You can add extra credit cards, and select one of them as "primary".  
     We will always try to charge the primary card first, and if it fails - try the others.  
* Wire Transfer
  Aproach our Support personnel to use wire transfer.

{PANEL: Billing}

Your charges are typically made once a month, on the last day of the month.  
As with all other financial data, we keep your invoices in the Billing Tab where you can always reach them.  

* Additional data that you can see in the billing tab includes:  
 - Daily cost  
 - Total cost
 - The expected charge in the end of this month

###Charging failures  

If we fail charging the owners of a Development or a Production instance using the 
payment method they provided, we'll notify them and retry for 7 days. If the problem 
persists, their instance will be closed.  

Users of a free instance that has breached its storage limitation, e.g. by stored backup 
files, will be notified of it by the daily billing routine. If they provided a payment 
method they will be charged by it, and if they haven't the instance will be closed.
