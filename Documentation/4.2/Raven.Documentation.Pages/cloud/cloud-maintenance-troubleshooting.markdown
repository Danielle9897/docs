| Label                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node not responding           | Product is currently not responding to input or commands. It suggests that the system may be experiencing a critical issue or is in an unresponsive state.                                                                                                                                                     |
| High CPU usage                | Product is experiencing a high level of CPU utilization. It suggests that the product's processor is under heavy load, which may affect performance.                                                                                                                                                           |
| High IO usage                 | Product is experiencing high input/output operations, which may indicate heavy disk or network activity. High I/O usage can slow down data processing and affect overall system performance, necessitating optimizations or resource upgrades.                                                                 |
| Low memory                    | Product is running low on available memory. It warns that the system may be close to using all its RAM, which can impact its ability to handle additional tasks. Low memory conditions can cause applications to slow down or crash, indicating a need for memory optimization or an increase in RAM capacity. |
| CPU Credits are low           | Product is running low on CPU credits (only on [burstable instances](cloud-overview#burstable-instances)). Low CPU credits can lead to reduced processing power, affecting performance. It may require adjusting resource allocation or upgrading to a higher credit tier.                                     |
| Free disk space - 10% left    | Product's available disk space is below 10%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Free disk space is very low   | Product's available disk space is below 7%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
