<p>Is the standard mid-day lunch killing our productivity? Which hours are your developers least productive making them ripe time to plan a meeting? Can workday hours be customized for individual developers around when they are the most productive? How long will a project really take, based on not just the hours needed, but the productive hours needed?</p>

<p>Developer analytics enable you to <em>optimize your budget</em> by rationally planning a timetable for each project.</p>

<p>Codealike tracks a developer team to help them enjoy greater productivity. Based on where you are working, what platforms you are working on, and other metrics, Codealike can enable you to find the best way to plan your days for you and your team. They do this by tracking and generating real time data from over 130 countries, hundreds of thousands of hours of detailed activity, hundreds of millions of activities to generate specific and aggregate metrics <em>powered by a RavenDB solution</em>.</p>
