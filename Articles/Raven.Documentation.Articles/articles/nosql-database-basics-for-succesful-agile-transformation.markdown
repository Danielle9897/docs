<h2><em>DevOps, Agile and microservices share a primary goal: Get it live NOW. Here’s how our NoSQL database architecture advances continuous delivery and continuous deployment.</em></h2>

<p>Over the past decade, organizations have been refitting every layer of their application in an ongoing bid to achieve continuous delivery and continuous deployment. Most have done this by automating as much of the process as possible. To date, around 50% of software development cycles have transformed to the new methodology. However, the other 50% are still only considering it.</p>

<p>The need has become even more pressing with the emergence of the cloud. The top organizations in your market will have maxed their agility by migrating to a platform that enables scale out with the click of a button – or less. Keeping up means every layer of your application stack is flexible enough to adapt to new features.</p>

<p>The toughest challenge is the layer that lies at the bottom of it all, and has traditionally been least malleable: your database.</p>

<h2> Achieve Early and Continuous Delivery of Your Project with This One Feature</h2>

<p>Many databases cannot natively handle the form and size of today’s data so they try to compensate with a confetti of addons. All these moving parts can grind your development process to a standstill. The right database for your agile and DevOps efforts must have everything in the box with low overhead and zero touch maintenance.</p>

<p>The RavenDB Multimodel NoSQL Database has it’s own storage engine, MapReduce for aggregating data, GUI to enable you to perform operations at the click of a mouse and to monitor the operational performance of your data, memory management like garbage collection, text search and prides itself on adapting to different environments while not needing any babysitting by the Database Administrator (DBA).</p>

<h2>Improve Business Agility and Faster Cycle Times with the Right NoSQL Database</h2>

<p>There are other must haves a database needs to offer in order to maintain optimal continuous delivery and continuous deployment schedules.</p>

<p>Schemaless. Nothing can grind your next release to a halt faster than a change to the schema. It’s like making a renovation to a skyscraper by changing the foundation of the building, that may take some time.</p>

<p>A document database is schemaless, enabling you to make changes at any point in your data systems efficiently and fast. You can take in multiple types of data dynamically, also saving time.</p>

<p>A Distributed Base Architecture. Multiple nodes serve many purposes. First, you have the ability to scale out on demand. Second, you can replicate your entire database, allowing your development team to build new features or fix current ones using live data. With RavenDB, you can do this without the need for third party tools.</p>

<p>A NoSQL database can support a distributed database architecture with the least amount of complexity or friction. A relational database, with scores of tables that all need to be joined, is complex to begin with and distributing it out can add to that complexity.</p>

<p>A distributed database aids in application testing. You can reduce test execution time by using a point-in-time clone of production data that won’t touch your live data. This is also ideal for shift-left testing where you can test as early as you want in the build process itself.</p>

<p>Point in time recovery. The big bottleneck to any release cycle is troubleshooting. A snapshot of the data at any point in production or testing enables you to quickly isolate what went wrong and what needs to be done to fix it.</p>

<p>RavenDB supports point-in-time recovery along with technical support that doesn’t hold you back. One of the biggest roadblocks is when you hand the controls over your next release to people who have no idea how urgent is it. Bad tech support can slow you down and freeze you up for hours, even days. If you have a database with lots of parts from other vendors, a tech engineer can simply resolve the issue on his end by saying “the problem is with the addon, speak to them.”</p>

<p>A database that has everything in the box and staffs its support team with the developers who built the database is best suited to handle every issue with urgency and efficiency. </p>

<p>For every development process the objective stays the same: extreme agility, rapid release time, continuous delivery and continuous deployment. A NoSQL Distributed Database Architecture is the key to an application that improves itself a hundred times a day.</p>
