<p>After using RavenDB 2.5 for five years, it was time to upgrade to their latest 4.1 version. Our <acronym title="Quick Service Restaurant"><em>QSR</em></acronym> platform currently operates with RavenDB embedded in <em>more than 36,000 locations worldwide</em>. We wanted to take advantage of RavenDB 4.1’s improved performance, native Voron storage engine, and improved tolerance to ungraceful shutdowns. We knew that upgrading from 2.5 straight to 4.1 would not be an easy task, but the new version presented us <em>a huge opportunity</em> to position our business towards accelerated innovation, modernization, and cloud capabilities.</p>

<p>In this session you will learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why RDI Software chose RavenDB for its QSR platform</li>
    <li>All the hurdles that massive-scale deployments add to the mix</li>
    <li>How the migration to Version 4.1 enables the future vision of our platform</li>
    <li>What were the trade-offs we had to make in moving from one version to the next</li>
</ul>
