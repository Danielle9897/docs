It is a core value of ours to provide your team with full technical support whenever you need it. While this presents the potential for me to make extra money off of you, I believe that would be counterproductive. My aim is to build a database that minimizes issues, so you can spend more time developing your application. 

## The Bottom Line

Our business model views tech support as a cost, not a new source of revenue. This focuses us to economize these costs by developing our database with the goal of providing as many built in fixes so you can spend less time on the phone with us trying to repair a paralyzed application. We understand that by reducing the time you need support, RavenDB shortens your release cycle and helps you get your app out ahead of the competition. 

This provides real impact on your bottom line.

## Your Time and Money are Important

In our experience with databases, we noticed that if you plan your database with too many knobs to turn or levers to pull, sooner or later the developers building apps around this database will have all sorts of questions for tech support on why everything isn’t working.

For the database developers, it’s a cash bonanza. For you, it can be a burden on your developer’s time, and certainly on your company’s resources. 

We built our database with this in mind: to provide the best tech support when you need it, but to develop RavenDB to fix the most common problems before a developer even encounters them so you need that support at little as possible. We have been in business since the very beginning of NoSQL databases. We have seen it all, and then some. We know that a lot of the most common issues can be fixed by developing automatic built in solutions into your database that resolve these issues before they put a roadblock in your path.

We know where the potholes are. Instead of waiting for you to step in them, we made sure to pave the road. As a result, you need tech support a lot less. The amount of tech support our clients need has dropped so much, we now charge a lot less for it. 

It gives us the chance to use this as a barometer of our most prized metric: making life easy for you. If the amount of time our support staff is fixing problems increases, then we know there are new issues which we need to build auto-fixes for. If the amount of support stays the same or keeps diminishing, it means that your development team has the resources to be more productive in releasing your next game-changing app. 

## Easy to Use, Simple to Maintain
