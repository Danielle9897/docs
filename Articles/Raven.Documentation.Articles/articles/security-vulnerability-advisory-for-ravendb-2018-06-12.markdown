<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A failure to sanitize input from a remote client can allow a privilege escalation attack, up to and including to the level of cluster administrator. This has been discovered as part of a routine audit&nbsp;of our code base by the security team. There are no known exploits at large or any indication that this has been discovered or&nbsp;used by anyone else.<br>
The fix version is now available and you should take <span style="color:#000;"><em>immediate</em></span> steps to upgrade all your RavenDB instances to alleviate this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding support and maintenance, make sure to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ravendb.net"><span style="color:#ca1c59;">support@ravendb.net</span></a> or <a href="mailto:security@ravendb.net"><span style="color:#ca1c59;">security@ravendb.net</span></a></p>
<p>Customers are urged to keep their support and maintenance contracts current, and to install the latest available updates to their installed products.</p>

<h3>Reseller information</h3>
<p>Immediately upgrade all publicly exposed RavenDB servers to the fixed version. If your RavenDB instances aren't publicly exposed, schedule upgrades to the fixed version as soon as possible. </p>
