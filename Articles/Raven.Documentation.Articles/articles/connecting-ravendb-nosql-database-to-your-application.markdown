We like to talk a lot about bundled transactions, ACID data integrity, and high performance. In this article, you get a peek under the hood of the database layer of your application to see how it works in real-time.

RavenDB Core Developer Michael Yarichuk goes step by step in connecting a RavenDB Document Database to an application and performs some CRUD operations to show you what RavenDB does to give you superior ROI for your IT infrastructure.

In this quick tour, you will see in code how RavenDB:

* Bundles transactions,
* Gives you the querying capabilities of a dedicated search engine,
* Makes it easy to write NoSQL data queries with its Raven Query (RQL) Language,
* Sets up aggregations.

You also have resources to use the RavenDB Bootcamp and to download RavenDB CEO Oren Eini's book *Inside RavenDB*.

When you're ready to take the first steps in connecting their application to a NoSQL Document Database with high performance and lots of pleasant surprises, <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5254222/RavenDB-A-NoSQL-Database-in-Easy-Mode" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this is just for you</a>.

If you are ready to take your application to the next level, we offer one on one live demonstrations of RavenDB given by our development team. Find the right time for you and [schedule yourself an opportunity](https://ravendb.net/live-demo) to move your data to the next generation of information.
